# Aesthetic Hardware Prototype

The aesthetic hardware prototype is a 3D printed moodel of the ideal device that would be used for the Memory Trail application. This device has been programmed on an ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and Arduino Language. Functionality that this device provides is the UI component of the device and the visual feedback of the buttons depending on the current state. The device is able to show ON/OFF colour changes and RECORD/PAUSE colour changes on button presses. For the large, audio button, a HOLD for 1s will be for FINISH RECORDING and will only turn a certain colour after the hold finishes.
